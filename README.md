### My name is Neil Wiborg

Hi there! I am a student at the University of Washington Bothell. I'm seeking a career as a software engineer, but for the time being this GitHub profile is just for personal and school projects.

Check out the **snl** repo to see my own C++ library I am developing.

Another interesting repo is **RandEpisodeUtil** which is a Java CLI app to choose a random episode of a TV show to watch.

Keep an eye out for more interesting projects from me!
